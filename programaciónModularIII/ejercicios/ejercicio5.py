Design a function called palindrome that has a string of characters as input parameter,
and returns True if it is a palindrome or False in other cases. A word is a palindrome if it
can be read the same from left to right or right to left, ignoring whites. For example:
"anilina" or "Dabale arroz a la zorra el abad" To simplify the problem, you can assume
that simple characters are used, that is, without tildes or diresis.
'''

string = "anilina"

def es_palindromo(characterString):
    check = False
    palabra = ""
    for i in range(len(characterString)):
        characterString
    return check

print(es_palindromo(string))
